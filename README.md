# A* Path Finding Algorithm for 2D Grid World
## AIM

To develop a code to find the route from the source to the destination point using A* algorithm for 2D grid world.

## THEORY

The A∗ algorithm is the most commonly used heuristic graph search algorithm for state space. In addition to solving problems based on state space, it is often used for the path planning of robots.
Algorithms of global path planning are mainly divided into two types: heuristic search methods and intelligent algorithms. The initial representation of the heuristic search is the A∗ algorithm developed by the Dijkstra algorithm. The A∗ algorithm is the most commonly used heuristic graph search algorithm for state space. 

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Build a 2D grid world with initial state , goal state and obstacles.

### STEP 2:
Within the execution introduce a class named GridProblem to find a path on a 2D grid with obstacles.

### STEP 3:
Calculate the straight line difference between the two points.

### Step 4:
Draw the pathbased on the plan given by get ridding the obstacles that is minimum in distance.

The Completeness and complexity of the algorithm:
 A* algorithm is a heuristic function based algorithm for proper path planning. It calculates heuristic function's value at each node on the work area and involves the checking of too many adjacent nodes for finding the optimal solution with zero probability of collision. Hence, it takes much processing time and decreases the work speed. 

## RESULT:

Thus, the algorithm to find the route from the source to the destination point using A* algorithm for 2D grid world.
